# macos-opensh

## Overview

"macos-opensh" is the first example application of the
GNU-Zebra/Quagga/FRR-like command-line shell library.
The "opensh" is a Cisco-like shell for "open"-ing files and directories
in MacOS. It shows a powerful ability when the name of the
file or directory is in the multi-byte language, e.g.,
the Jananese UTF-8 filenames.

"macos-opensh" is a derivative of a proprietary program,
and in the hope for me to freely dual-licensing the proprietary program,
(and because I haven't prepared the necessary preparation yet,)
for now I don't accept pull-requests.

## License

GPLv3.

## Installation

- Homebrew's gcc and automake/autoconf are the prerequisites.
- Below will install the opensh in $HOME/macos/bin/.

```
% aclocal
% autoheader
% automake --add-missing -c
% autoconf
% ./configure
% make && make install
```

## Usage

'?' provides a list of command candidates.
When your shell is in the <FILENAME> command node,
'?' provides a list of file candidates.
'TAB' will complete the command argument
as long as it is common among the candidates.

If you type '>' in the <FILENAME> command node, the shell enters
the ''file select mode'', where vi or emacs cursor move is accepted.
If you 'enter' in the file select mode, the candidate the cursor was on
is expanded in the command line.
'q' in the file select mode cancels the file select mode.

## Known Issues

- Removing the UTF-8 filename backward from the end does not work yet.
  (The shell removes it one-byte at a time in (e.g.,) UTF-8 four encoded bytes.
- The spaces in directory names are not handled correctly.
- The more-than-one spaces in file name is not handled correctly.
  (It is canonicalized as just one space in the command matching process.)

## TODO

- multi-match in command match process.
